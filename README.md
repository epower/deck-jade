# Deck JS Jade Boilerplate

A happy combination of deck.js (https://github.com/imakewebthings/deck.js) and jade (https://github.com/visionmedia/jade).

This is a deck.js boilerplate slide set with a bower install file for dependencies. Fork it and make quick online presentations.

To quickly try out presentations, I've used this with quickyJade (https://github.com/FuturaIO/quickyJade). To run:

  npm install -g quickyjade
  quickyjade
